1) High-level architecture (system map)

Frontend: React (TypeScript) + Tailwind (or Tailwind-like) UI, WebGL/three.js for 3D Vision Room, Zustand/Redux for state, WebSocket for realtime features.

Backend API: Node.js (TypeScript) — NestJS or Express with modular structure, GraphQL or REST (I recommend REST for clarity; GraphQL optional for flexible queries).

Database: PostgreSQL (relational for core data) + Redis (caching, sessions, leaderboards) + S3-compatible object storage for images/videos.

Search / Feed: ElasticSearch (or Meilisearch) for fast search of public boards and tags.

AI Services: Hosted LLM (OpenAI / Azure / Anthropic) for Goal Builder, prompts; a small ML service for mood analysis (audio/text sentiment) — can start with LLM sentiment + heuristics.

Realtime: WebSockets (Socket.IO) for presence, collaborative editing, notifications.

Worker Queue: BullMQ (Redis-backed) to process heavy tasks: image video rendering (shareable GIFs), exporting boards, AI batch jobs.

Hosting: Kubernetes (or managed services like Vercel for frontend + AWS/GCP for backend), CI/CD pipelines, Dockerized services.

Monitoring: Sentry, Prometheus + Grafana.

2) Core bounded contexts / services

Auth & Users — sign-up, OAuth, profiles, preferences.

VisionBoards — create/edit boards, assets (images/video/audio/text), privacy (public/private).

Goals & Tasks — goal models, micro-tasks, habits, progress.

Calendar & Habits — sync with goals, recurring tasks, habit check-ins.

AI Assistant — goal generator, planner, weekly analysis.

Social / Feed — public inspiration wall, trending goals, challenge engine.

Gamification — streaks, badges, points, leaderboards.

Sharing/Export — render GIF/video of board, share links, embed.

Notifications — push/email/in-app reminders.

Analytics — user progress tracking, retention, funnels.

3) Tech stack (recommended)

Frontend: React + TypeScript, Vite or Next.js (Next if SSR needed), Tailwind CSS, three.js for 3D, Framer Motion for animation.

State: Zustand (global) or Redux Toolkit.

Backend: Node.js + TypeScript, NestJS (modular, scalable) or Express + TypeDI.

DB: PostgreSQL (with Prisma ORM) or TypeORM.

Cache/Queue: Redis, BullMQ.

Search: Meilisearch (simpler) or ElasticSearch.

Storage: AWS S3 (or DigitalOcean Spaces).

AI: OpenAI GPT-4o or similar via API.

Auth: Auth0, Clerk, or custom JWT + refresh tokens. OAuth for Google/Apple.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions.

Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes (or managed: AWS ECS/Fargate). Frontend on Vercel/Netlify.

4) Data models (SQL-ish) — core tables
-- users
users (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  email text UNIQUE,
  name text,
  avatar_url text,
  password_hash text, -- if using own auth
  created_at timestamptz,
  last_active timestamptz,
  preferences jsonb
);

Realtime

WebSocket channels: user:{id}, board:{boardId}, notifications:{userId}

6) UI / UX — page-by-page + components + states

Use Next.js pages or React routes. Keep UI minimal + aesthetic (Notion × Pinterest vibe). Use Tailwind for rapid development.

Global components

TopNav (logo, search, create button, notifications, profile menu)

LeftSidebar (Home, My Boards, Calendar, Challenges, Analytics)

RightPanel (context: selected goal preview, AI assistant)

FloatingActionButton (create goal/board)

3DCanvas wrapper for three.js scene

AssetUploader (drag & drop + upload progress)

ShareModal, ExportModal (render options)

Key pages & UI behaviors
A) Home / Feed (Public Inspiration Wall)

Masonry grid of public boards as cards

Card shows cover GIF, title, owner, tags, like/share buttons

Filters: trending / new / category / tags

On hover, quick preview + CTA "Open Board" or "Save Template"

B) Board Editor — main experience (desktop-first)

Layout: large central canvas (3D room / 2D canvas), left side toolbar (assets, text, widgets), right side properties panel (selected item properties), top bar (save, publish, share, AI assistant button).

Modes:

3D Vision Room: user navigates a virtual room: walls are panels where assets hang.

Controls: drag-drop into room, scale/rotate/position, depth ordering.

Snap-to-grid / align guides.

Camera presets (front, left, room overview) and small minimap.

2D Collage Mode: for simpler editing (drag/resize).

Timeline Mode: arrange assets for animated export (short GIF/video).

Editing flow:

Create board → choose template (travel, career, health).

Add asset via uploader / stock image search / embed URL.

Drop into canvas: default places it on wall; open properties to add alt text, tags, target goal association.

Link asset → goal: each asset can be tagged to a goal; clicking asset opens Goal quick-edit.

Save periodically (auto-save), version history.

Right-panel: goal quick actions: connect to calendar/habits, set target date, assign micro-tasks.

C) Goal Detail

Header: title, progress ring, target date, achievement probability (AI-estimated)

Tabs: Plan, Habits, Calendar, Journal, Resources

Plan: shows steps with ETA, estimated time, priority values (AI)

Habits: toggle daily tasks, check-in button, streak display

Journal: voice entry (record), text logs

D) Calendar / Habit Tracker

Month/week/day view

Habit check-in quick toggles

Integrations: Google Calendar sync (optional)

Visuals: colored days (green, yellow, red) representing progress

Boost Mode: when falling behind, shows "Sprint Plan" cards

E) AI Assistant Modal

Input box + suggested prompts:

“Make my 3-year career vision into 5 SMART goals”

“Turn this board into a 30-day plan”

Outputs: list of goals with micro-tasks, priority, suggested daily habits

Buttons: Accept to export into board/goals or refine

F) Profile & Analytics

Life Balance Wheel (radar chart)

Progress timeline

Badges / points

Privacy settings & connected accounts

7) UI Visual & Interaction details (visual language)

Color palette: neutral background, bold accent (for progress & CTA), subtle cards with 2xl rounded corners.

Typography: variable fonts (big headings, readable body).

Motion: Framer Motion for micro-interactions: asset drop, goal completion confetti.

Accessibility: keyboard navigation, ARIA labels for canvas controls, color contrast checks.

Mobile: responsive collapse of sidebars, simplified canvas (2D only) with pinch zoom and object selection.

8) 3D Vision Room technical details

Use three.js inside a React wrapper (react-three-fiber).

Scene Graph:

Room (floor, walls) with configurable textures.

Panels as rectangles mapped to wall positions.

AssetMeshes (plane geometries with textures) for images; VideoTexture for videos.

Controls: OrbitControls tuned to limit camera rotation (prevent going through walls).

Serialization: store each asset's transform (position: x,y,z; rotation; scale) in assets.metadata.

Performance: LOD for mobile, dynamic texture resolution, lazy-load assets in view.

9) AI components — how they connect, prompts, and flow
A) Goal Builder (Core LLM flow)

Input: user prompt + board context + user profile (optional)

Function:

Summarize user prompt → extract intents.

Generate 3–7 SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

For each goal produce: description, target_date, milestones, micro-tasks (daily/weekly), suggested habits, estimated difficulty & required time.

Example prompt to LLM:

User profile: {age, occupation, main_interests}
Vision description: "I want to level up my design skills and build a portfolio to get freelance clients."
Generate 5 SMART goals, each with 4 milestones, estimated weekly time, recommended daily habits, suggested resources (book/article/video), sample weekly plan for 12 weeks.

B) Weekly Summary & Coach

Aggregates calendar check-ins + goal progress + mood entries → LLM returns a summary and targeted recommendations.

Also suggests a "Sprint Plan" if lagging.

C) Mood / Audio Analysis

For voice journals: extract text (speech-to-text with Whisper-like model) then run sentiment analysis.

Output: mood_score, emotional_tags, suggested micro-actions (breathing, journaling, break).

Use small hosted models or LLM sentiment APIs.

D) Template & Copy Generation

LLM generates catchy titles, share captions (one-click share text + hashtags) for social exports.

Security / Privacy: always ask user consent before sending private board content to AI; anonymize where possible.

10) Gamification & Social mechanics

Points: awarded for check-ins, streaks, finishing goals.

Badges: milestone-based (First 7-day streak, First board shared, 5 goals completed).

Challenges: community challenges (e.g., 21-day fitness), leaderboard.

Accountability pairs: invite friends to follow progress; shared check-ins.

Social feed: users can like/save public boards, follow creators.

11) Sharing / Export pipeline

Export GIF/Video:

Render sequence from three.js scenes (headless or offscreen canvas).

Send frames to worker that uses FFmpeg to compose GIF/MP4.

Store in S3 and provide share link.

Share cards: generate open-graph meta with small rendered preview for social.

Embedding: provide embed iframe for public boards.

12) Notifications & Reminders

Push: Web Push / Mobile push (Firebase).

Email: transactional + weekly summary.

In-app: realtime toasts + notification center.

Smart reminders: contextual (if user hasn't checked in by 10 AM, friendly nudge); adaptive frequency when user is disengaged.

13) Security, privacy, and data governance

Private boards must default to private. Public boards require explicit opt-in.

Encryption: TLS everywhere; encrypt sensitive PII fields at rest if required.

Consent: clear popup before sending content to external AI API.

Rate-limiting & input sanitization.

Audit logs for critical operations.

GDPR/CCPA readiness (export user data / delete on request).

14) Scaling & performance considerations

Use CDN (CloudFront) for static assets.

Cache commonly viewed public boards in Redis.

Offload heavy exports/rendering to background workers and scale workers horizontally.

Pagination/cursor-based endpoints for feed.

Throttle AI calls & cache AI outputs for repeat prompts.

15) Observability & analytics

Track user retention (DAU/MAU), funnel (create board → add asset → create goal → check-in).

Product metrics: average streak length, percent of goals achieved, average check-ins per user.

Events: board_created, goal_created, checkin, share, ai_request.

A/B test onboarding flows and templates.

16) MVP — what to build first (must-have)

Goal: usable product that validates core value: create vision board, set goals, track habits, AI helps plan.

Auth (email) + basic profile

Create simple 2D Vision Board (not full 3D) — drag & drop assets

Goals + micro-tasks model

Calendar + habit check-in (manual)

AI Goal Builder (1 endpoint, LLM)

Public feed (view & share as link)

Notifications (email + in-app)

Export basic shareable image (no video)
This gives a testable product quickly. After validation, add 3D room, GIF/Video export, advanced AI, and social features.

17) Implementation roadmap (features order — without time estimates)

Core backend + DB models; auth

Basic frontend: board editor (2D), goal CRUD, calendar

AI Goal Builder integration + UI

Habit check-ins + points/badges

Public feed + search

Export image + share links

3D Vision Room (three.js)

Realtime collaboration

Mobile optimizations + push notifications

Advanced analytics & ML mood analysis

18) Example workflows & how modules talk
Workflow 1 — Create a goal from scratch

User clicks “Add Goal” in Board Editor.

Frontend posts POST /api/goals → backend creates db record.

Optionally call POST /api/ai/generate-goals with goal prompt to flesh out milestones.

LLM returns milestones; backend stores them as tasks.

User chooses to schedule tasks → backend creates calendar_entries.

User completes a task → frontend POST /api/tasks/:id/checkin.

Backend updates streaks, points, push to WebSocket user:{id} to show real-time update.

Workflow 2 — Weekly AI summary

Cron job or user-triggered button calls POST /api/ai/week-summary with user progress data.

Backend composes context (calendar entries, progress, mood logs) and sends to LLM.

LLM returns suggestions; backend saves summary and notifies user.

19) Sample UI wireframe text (for designers)

Board Editor — Top Bar
Left: Back | Board title (editable) | Template dropdown
Center: Save (auto) | Publish button | Share
Right: AI Assistant icon | Export | User avatar

Canvas

Big empty space with grid.

Left vertical toolbar icons: Assets, Text, Goals, Widgets, Templates.

Right side properties panel: shows object properties when selected (title, link to goal, transform controls).

Bottom timeline strip for animated exports.

Goal Card

Small card with circular progress, title, target date, quick actions (check, edit, schedule).

Calendar

Month view: each day shows small progress ring and tasks list (expand on click).

20) Extensibility & future ideas (post-MVP)

Mobile first native apps (React Native / Flutter).

Multi-user boards for teams or families.

Integrations: fitness trackers, budgeting APIs, Google Calendar.

Marketplace: paid templates, coaches, premium AI planning.

White-label for schools/organizations (education packages).

21) Example code snippets (starter hints)
Minimal Express route to create a goal (TypeScript)
// controllers/goal.ts
import { Request, Response } from 'express';
import db from '../db';

export async function createGoal(req: Request, res: Response) {
  const { boardId, title, description, targetDate } = req.body;
  const ownerId = req.user.id;
  const result = await db.query(
    `INSERT INTO goals (board_id, owner_id, title, description, target_date) VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4,$5) RETURNING *`,
    [boardId, ownerId, title, description, targetDate]
  );
  res.status(201).json(result.rows[0]);
}

Sample AI request payload
{
  "user_profile": { "occupation": "student", "interests": ["design","photography"] },
  "vision_text": "I want to be a freelance designer with steady clients in 12 months",
  "constraints": { "hours_per_week": 8 }
}

22) Production checklist (before public launch)

Load test endpoints (500–1k concurrent).

Security audit & pen testing.

Privacy policy & TOS (AI usage disclosures).

Backup & disaster recovery for DB.

Onboarding flows and analytics instrumentation.
